This project predicts a student's final performance based on study hours,
attendance, and previous academic scores using a supervised machine learning model.

## Project Workflow
1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Train Linear Regression model
4. Evaluate model performance
5. Visualize actual vs predicted values

## Results
The model demonstrates a clear relationship between academic features
and final performance.
